# DisplayInformationSite
A simple intro-level website that utilizes JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

This was the first assignment in a web development course at Texas State University.

This project was created for Dr. Visinescu during Fall of 2019 using IntelliJ.

This website will retrieve values input by a user for first name, last name, date of birth, email and password.
The Javascript file will serve a few different purposes apart from displaying the input information under the form.
Firstly, the Javascript will confirm that both passwords entered match, and if not display an alert to the user.
Secondly, the Javascript will take the date of birth input by the user, and calculate the current age of that user.
Lastly, the Javascript will display all information including the users age (instead of DOB) in an element under the input fields.

The main lesson this project served for us to learn was how to properly utilize javascript to play with values input by users.
The biggest challenge was finding the correct function to use in order to calculate age.
